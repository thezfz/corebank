"""
Repositories module for CoreBank.

This module contains the data access layer of the CoreBank system:
- Database connection management
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Query implementations
- Transaction support

Repositories provide a clean abstraction over the database layer,
allowing the service layer to work with domain objects without
knowing the details of data persistence.
