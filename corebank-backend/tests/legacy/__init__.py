"""
Legacy tests that need to be updated.

These tests were moved here because they reference modules or classes
that no longer exist in the current codebase structure. They need to be
updated to match the current architecture before they can be used.

TODO:
- Update test_user_repository.py to use PostgresRepository instead of UserRepository
- Update test_auth_service.py to use current service structure
- Fix import paths and module references
